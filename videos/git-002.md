# Git vs Github

- Git == Version Control System (VCS)

**other eg:** Mercurial, Subversion etc

- Github == Platform for hosting source code

**other eg:** GitLabs, BitBucket etc

Hence  ***Git != Github***

# What is a Repository

- Project
- Folder
- File

For example:

- An Android Project

Any Project on Github == **Repository or Repo**
